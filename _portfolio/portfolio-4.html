The data was loaded into a database hosted on Google Cloud's BigQuery, using the test space of this platform and cleaned through different SQL queries, excluding data generalized by areas or regions, such as data provided by the World Bank, the World Health Organization and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, as well as a total count of the entire world that the dataset had.
The data were joined through JOIN queries in order to complement the analysis.
